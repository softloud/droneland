The goal of droneland is to calculate the area of land captured by a drone image.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("softloud/droneland")
```

## Example

Suppose we have a drone image of 7952 x 5304 pixels taken from 200 metres with a camera angled at 25 degrees with a vertical field of view of 38 degrees and a horizontal field of view of 54 degrees. Then the area of land captured, in metres, is

```{r}
library(droneland)

drone_image_area(
  camera_angle = 25,
  vertical_fov = 38,
  horizontal_fov = 44,
  height = 200,
  pixel_row = 7952,
  pixel_col = 5304
)

```


## Diagrams of angles and derivations

Check [my derivations](https://www.overleaf.com/read/twnpsndycrgw), please and thank you :) 

In the derivations there are diagrams to check what angles to input.
