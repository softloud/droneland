\arguments{
\item{camera_angle}{Angle of the camera in degrees, as measured from the
height of the drone.}

\item{vertical_fov}{Vertical field of view of the camera, in degrees.}

\item{horizontal_fov}{Horizontal field of view of the camera, in degrees.}

\item{height}{Height of the drone in metres.}

\item{pixel_row}{Number of rows of pixels recorded.}

\item{pixel_col}{Number of columns of pixels recorded.}

\item{dim}{Output a list of the dimensions, two bases and height, of trapezoid.}
}
\value{
Area of the trapezoid captured in the image, measured in metres
squared.
