The goal of droneland is to calculate the area of land captured by a
drone image, using the method outlined in this
[manuscript](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2017.1280639).

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("softloud/droneland")
```

## Example

Suppose we have a drone image of 7952 x 5304 pixels taken from 200
metres with a camera angled at 25 degrees with a vertical field of view
of 38 degrees and a horizontal field of view of 54 degrees. Then the
area of land captured, in metres, is

``` r
library(droneland)

drone_image_area(
  camera_angle = 25,
  vertical_fov = 38,
  horizontal_fov = 54,
  height = 200,
  pixel_row = 7952,
  pixel_col = 5304
)
#> [1] 105366.1

# dimensions of trapezoid

drone_image_area(
  camera_angle = 25,
  vertical_fov = 38,
  horizontal_fov = 54,
  height = 200,
  pixel_row = 7952,
  pixel_col = 5304,
  dim = TRUE
) %>% purrr::map(round)
#> $height
#> [1] 299
#> 
#> $width_closest
#> [1] 200
#> 
#> $width_furthest
#> [1] 505
```

## Diagrams of angles and derivations

Check [my derivations](https://www.overleaf.com/read/twnpsndycrgw),
please and thank you :)

In the derivations there are diagrams to check what angles to input.
